# PolyChess

PolyChess (named polychess as Git repository) is a Chess engine written in Python and used as practicals for a course on project management at the engineering school Polytech Annecy-Chamb√©ry. 

The aim of this repository is not to provide any complete Chess engine since students have to do it based on python-chess. As a consequence, persons interested in this project should check the different forks.
